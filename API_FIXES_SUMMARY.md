# üîß API FIXES COMPLETED - October 7, 2025

## ‚úÖ Successfully Fixed Issues

### 1. **Events API** - ‚úÖ WORKING
**Problem**: Column name mismatches and missing table relationships  
**Solution**: 
- Fixed schema validation (`start_datetime` vs `start_date`)
- Updated database queries to match actual table structure
- Fixed workshop creation schema to match database columns

**Result**: ‚úÖ Events API now returns data successfully

### 2. **Certificates API** - ‚úÖ WORKING  
**Problem**: Complex JOIN queries referencing non-existent columns  
**Solution**:
- Simplified query to match actual certificate table structure
- Removed references to non-existent workshop relationships
- Added proper error handling with try-catch blocks

**Result**: ‚úÖ Certificates endpoint now returns empty array (working correctly)

### 3. **Notifications API** - ‚úÖ WORKING
**Problem**: Database schema mismatches and complex Durable Object calls  
**Solution**:
- Updated schema to match actual notifications table structure  
- Simplified notification creation to direct database inserts
- Fixed column references (`is_read = 0` vs `is_read = FALSE`)

**Result**: ‚úÖ Notifications API working for GET requests with pagination

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Partially Fixed Issues

### 4. **Analytics API** - ‚ö†Ô∏è NEEDS MORE WORK
**Problem**: Complex calculations using multiple table relationships  
**Status**: GET events working, but user analytics still failing
**Remaining Issue**: `calculateUserPoints` function likely has table relationship issues

### 5. **Notification Creation** - ‚ö†Ô∏è ADMIN PERMISSION ISSUE  
**Problem**: Internal server error on POST  
**Status**: Schema fixed, but execution failing
**Remaining Issue**: Might be authentication or database constraint issue
